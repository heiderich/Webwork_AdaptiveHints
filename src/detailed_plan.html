<h2>Transport Layer</h2>

<p>To unify the low level communication and provide checking we will a
Socket class, both on the javascript side and on the server side. The
socket provide the infrastructure for sending JSON packets back and
forth.
The Socket class supports the following public methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Open</em>(server-address, @NewCallBack, @StatusCallBack): opens a connection
to the server.
<ul>
<li>@NewCallBack is a pointer to a subroutine that is called when a new
packet is available from the server.</li>
<li>@StatusCallBack points to a subroutine that is called when an valid
acknowledgement is recieved from the other side or if repeated
attempts to connect have failed (according to some retry policy).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Send</em> (packet): sends a JSON packet.</li>
<li><em>Close</em>: close the connection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Client</h2>

<p>The client will be written in JavaScript and use the BackBone
Model-View pattern.</p>

<p><em>Yoav:</em> As I am ignorant about JavaScript, I will not attempt a
detailed description here, but just give a high-level description of
the needed functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Parse HTML:</em> Send The HTML to the server and get back a modified
HTML. The Modified HTML has ID's associated with each of the
question-answer pairs. (By having this Parsing done on the server
we make sure that there is no mismatch between the server and the
client. I need to check with Gage, but the HTML might be cached on
the server, in which case only an index would have to be sent to
the hint server).</li>
<li><em>HeartBeat:</em> each client sends a "heartbeat" packet to the server
every 10 seconds or so. This way the server knows which clients are
active. From the "Ack" reply of the server the client knows whether
or not it has a working connection to the hints server.</li>
<li><em>Capture Keystrokes:</em> The script will listen for keystrokes on each
of the boxes (both of original questions and of hints). When
keystrokes are captured, they will be sent to the server every 5
seconds (not waiting for the <CR>)</li>
<li><em>Insert hints:</em> When the script recieves a hint, together with an
index that defines the location. It inserts the hint in the
appropriate place and starts a new listener for the answer.</li>
<li><em>Submit:</em> The final evaluation of the answers will be performed just
as it is now - when the user presses the "submit" button. However,
to allow continuity this submit is intercepted by the script which
send the appropriate "POST" to the webwork server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>Unlike the client, the server maintains a large number of
connections. It does not initiate opening connections, but responds to
incoming open requests.</p>

<p>As the server might need to serve many students and TAs/Tutors at the
same time, we plan to use multiple threads, each thread servicing
multiple connections.</p>

<p>Each thread uses a separate port, I will refer to them as port0,port1
etc. Port0 is special in that it is where the connection is initiated,
the other ports are used for actual communication. </p>

<p>Server_Transport consists of the following classes:
* ConnectionListener: listens on port0 for requests for a new
  connection. Upon recieving a request, either assigns it to an
  existing StudentServer or TAServer, or starts a new student server on a new port.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>StudentState: a data structure holding the student's state.</p>

<ul>
<li>Current PG file</li>
<li>Current HTML </li>
<li>Keystrokes (timestamped)</li>
<li>Hints recieved (timestamped)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>StudentServer: A class for handling updates to the student
state. Each student server uses a separate port for communicating and a
list of StudentState instances that it manages.</p></li>
<li><p>TAState: The list of students that the TA is currently helping. A
pointer to the StudentState for each of those.</p></li>
<li><p>TAServer: Similar to StudentServer, but for TA's</p></li>
</ul>
