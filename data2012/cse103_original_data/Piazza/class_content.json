[{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"\nPiazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:\n\n1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>\n\nThe best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).\n\n2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>\n\nThink of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors\u2019 answer</b> for instructors).\n\n3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>\n\nTo comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.\n\n4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>\n\nShy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.\n\n5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>\n\nIt's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a \u201c#\u201d before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.\n\n6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>\n\nAdding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. \nMathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.\n\n7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>\n\nClick the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources\u2014all in one place!\n\n\nContact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>. We love feedback!","subject":"Welcome to Piazza!","created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":["student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":0,"tag_good":[],"config":{"is_default":1},"id":"h71eq0ee67s1vv","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa","data":"h71eq0egefd1vw"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">PA.load(\"/dashboard/tips_tricks\", null, function(data){ $('#' + 'questionText').html(data);});</script>","subject":"Tips & Tricks for a successful class","created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":["private","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":1,"tag_good":[],"config":{"is_default":1},"id":"h71eq0gbzxj1vx","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa","data":"h71eq0gdrt91vy"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"private"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">PA.load(\"/dashboard/get_familiar\", null, function(data){ $('#' + 'questionText').html(data);});</script>","subject":"Get familiar with Piazza","created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":["private","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":2,"tag_good":[],"config":{"is_default":1},"id":"h71eq0h07l51vz","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa","data":"h71eq0hk35j1w0"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"private"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">PA.load(\"/dashboard/introduce_piazza\", null, function(data){ $('#' + 'questionText').html(data);});</script>","subject":"Introduce Piazza to your students","created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":["private","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":3,"tag_good":[],"config":{"is_default":1},"id":"h71eq0i8osn1w1","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa","data":"h71eq0ia3yn1w2"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-13T05:17:40Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"private"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">PA.load(\"/dashboard/project_partners\", null, function(data){ $('#' + 'questionText').html(data);});</script> #pin","subject":"Form project teams & study groups!","created":"2012-09-13T05:17:41Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":4,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"id":"h71eq1arbkm1wm","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-13T05:17:41Z","uid":"gd6v7134AUa","data":"h71eq1awvx1wn"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-13T05:17:41Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"Welcome to the Piazza for CSE103.\nHere is the place for you to post all of your questions to me, the TA's, the Tutors and your fellow students.\n\nIt works much better than emails or messages from inside WebWork.\n\nLooking forward to you postings!\nProfessor Freund \n#welcome","subject":"Hi!","created":"2012-09-29T00:09:43Z","uid":"gs94ftup6ph"}],"type":"note","children":[],"tags":["instructor-note","welcome"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":5,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"id":"h7nyrlwr2lm22n","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-09-29T00:09:43Z","uid":"gs94ftup6ph","data":"h7nyrlwtg0322o"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-09-29T00:09:43Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"I went to Moodle and found the Peer Instruction Group table but I can not add any names to the table.

We can do this because for every color combination, there is exactly one corresponding arrangement of stars and bars. Why is this the case? \n\nWell, you can try to imagine that we have an arrangement of c boxes each with at least b balls, and a robot named Rob. Rob reads input from a tape as stars and bars, and he reads one character at a time. Rob starts at the leftmost box, and whenever he reads a star, he takes out a ball from the box he is currently at, and whenever he reads a bar, he moves to the next box(to the right).\n\nNow, if we want b balls, then clearly we want his tape to have b stars. Also, since we have c colors but start from the first one already, we would need c-1 bars so that it's possible for Rob to take out a ball from any of the c boxes of different colored balls. Lastly, we can see that for every color combination we can easily construct the string of stars and bars that would have Rob pick out the right number of times from each box. First, we sort the color combination in the same order as the boxes are ordered(we can do this since order doesn't matter with combinations). Then, we append to the initially empty string the number of bars we need to move to the box we want to get a ball from, append the number of stars depending on how many we want, and repeat until we have chosen all the balls. After the last star the remaining bars don't do anything since Rob would just move to the next box and not grab anything. So, by construction we can see that finding the number of ways to arrange stars and bars with b stars and c-1 bars solves the number of color combinations we can make with b balls and c colors. \n\nIf it's still not clear perhaps I can provide an example. Let's say we have 3 colors: red,white, black, and we want to get 3 balls. We can let our imaginary row of boxes balls be arranged in that same order: (red, white, black).\n\nOne possible color combination is RWB. How do we get the corresponding stars and bars? We can have * | * | *  which would make us pick out a red, move to white, pick out a white, move to black, and pick out a black.\nAnother possible color combination is RRR. To get this , we would have * * * | | which would make us pick out 3 reds, then move to white and black(not picking any of those).\nAnd yet another one is WWB. To get this, we need | * * | * which would make us move to white, pick 2, then move to black, and pick the final one. \n\nOne final note is that for the color combinations, order is irrelevant, so WWB is the same as WBW or BWW. The only thing we need to know is that there are 2 whites and 1 black, and the order in which we get them is irrelevant. \n\nIf I just made things even more complicated, sorry and forget everything I said.","uid":"glviobylIFz","bucket_name":"Yesterday","data":null},{"type":"feedback","children":[],"anon":"no","config":{},"id":"h7tbus03fff1ns","bucket_order":3,"updated":"2012-10-02T18:14:56Z","created":"2012-10-02T18:14:56Z","rank_debug":false,"subject":"The way I see this question is that there are 3 different balls and 11 different colors (and order does not matter), so there are 3 positions to pick 11 different colors.

I think it's easier to explain with an example. \n\nSo, let's say we have 5 people in a contest. If we want to find the number of ways people can place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, then we would need to find permutations. That is, the matter in which the people are placed is relevant. Then, Alice, Bob, and Charles is a valid permutation and Bob, Alice, and Charles, is another valid permutation, and they are not equivalent because the first corresponds to Alice being first, Bob 2nd, and so forth while the other one corresponds to Bob being first and so on. \n\nHowever, if we are only looking for the number of combinations in which 3 people place, and we don't care about the order in which they place, then the order is irrelevant. That is, Alice, Bob, and Charles being placed is equivalent to Bob, Charles, and Alice.\n\nYou can also think of it as the number of ways we can make sets of 3 people as opposed to tuples of 3 people, corresponding to combinations and permutations respectively. \n\nIn short, the order is significant in permutations while for combinations it is not. For a permutation, (a, b, c) is not the same as (b, a, c) while for combinations they are the same.","subject":"","created":"2012-10-02T22:23:22Z","uid":"glviobylIFz"}],"children":[],"tag_endorse_arr":["gv5rzn7up1u2fy","h7qzzqrik2i35t"],"config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"h7tkq9jmg357co","tag_endorse":[{"facebook_id":null,"email":"mzluo@ucsd.edu","id":"gv5rzn7up1u2fy","photo":null,"name":"Michael Luo","us":false,"admin":false},{"facebook_id":null,"email":"rquinlan@ucsd.edu","id":"h7qzzqrik2i35t","photo":null,"name":"Ryan Van Quinlan","us":false,"admin":false}],"created":"2012-10-02T22:23:22Z","rank_debug":false,"data":{"embed_links":[]},"bucket_name":"Today"}],"tags":["question","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":28,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h7tjxjh9hac31e","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"full","when":"2012-10-02T22:01:02Z","data":"h7tjxjhb8kj31f"},{"type":"i_answer","to":"h7tjxjh9hac31e","anon":"no","when":"2012-10-02T22:23:22Z","uid":"glviobylIFz","data":"h7tkq9jrh4d7cp"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-10-02T22:01:02Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"full","content":"For the first question, part 1 i'm having trouble understanding what the question is asking.

So, we have variables: a, b, and c, and instead of reasoning about the variables themselves, we instead want to reason about the differences $$(30 - c)$$, $$(c - b)$$, $$(b - a)$$, and $$(a - 5)$$. Why can we do this? Well, there is a one to one correspondence between these differences and the values of the variables a, b, and c. \n\nFor example, you can see that in the case $$a = b = c = 5$$, we must have $$(a - 5 = 0)$$, $$(b - a = 0)$$, $$(c - b = 0)$$, and $$(30 - c = 25)$$. Try more examples to convince yourself that this works. Formally, we know that for any a, $$a - 5$$ will be unique to that a. Then, for any b given some a, $$b - a$$ is also a one to one function, and the same for c. \n\nNow, we use these findings to reduce the problem to something we already know how to solve. We can consider the differences to each be &quot;buckets&quot; of which there are 4. Then,we can consider the actual value of the difference to be the number of &quot;balls&quot; inside of it. So in the case that $$a = 8$$, the &quot;bucket&quot; $$a - 5$$ would have 3 &quot;balls&quot;.\n\nThis is just a stars and bars problem, which we know how to solve! With that we get $$\\frac{ (25 + 4 - 1)! } { (4 - 1)!25! }$$","uid":"glviobylIFz","bucket_name":"Today","data":null}],"tags":["question","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":42,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h7v8656g52i36v","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"stud","when":"2012-10-04T02:07:21Z","uid":"h7lf7v9f8uh1st","data":"h7v8656ijm036w"},{"type":"i_answer","to":"h7v8656g52i36v","anon":"no","when":"2012-10-04T02:57:11Z","uid":"gs94ftup6ph","data":"h7v9y8hok5h61v"},{"type":"i_answer_update","anon":"no","when":"2012-10-04T02:58:29Z","uid":"gs94ftup6ph","data":"h7v9zwjxfzq5f"},{"type":"followup","to":"h7v8656g52i36v","anon":"no","when":"2012-10-04T03:08:53Z","uid":"glviobylIFz"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-10-04T02:07:21Z","rank_debug":false,"status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"full","content":"I do not understand the question that asks for the size of the outcome space for tossing the coin, isn't there only H,T in the outcome space so the size is 2? \n#homework3 #5","subject":"Problem 5","created":"2012-10-04T03:55:40Z"}],"type":"question","children":[{"type":"i_answer","history":[{"anon":"no","content":"Hi, the outcome space would be 2 if we were asking for the outcome space of a single coin flip.

The reason 3 suits can not be repeated is because by definition if a suit were to be repeated there would have to be 2 cards of the same suit. So, for 3 suits to be repeated we'd need 6 cards, which is why it's not possible.\n\nDoes that help? Also, as Joshua pointed out, you can count the total number of possible straights first and remove the combinations you don't want, which is what I was trying to get at. That's probably the easiest way of solving this problem, although I stress again that it's always good to know multiple ways to get at a solution. \n\n@Joshua:\nI believe that your answer should work by the method you described.

For this problem, the size of the tuple is irrelevant, so I decided to go with <i>i</i> = 4.    \n\nThis means that {1,2,3,4} would be the set where <b>Person 1</b> has a birthday on <b>January 1st</b>, <b>Person 2</b> has a birthday on <b>January 2nd</b>, <b>Person 3</b> has a birthday on <b>January 3rd</b>, and so on and so forth.  \n\nThus, the event set of a situation where Person 1 has a birthday on January 1st, Person 2 has a birthday on January 2nd, Person 3 has a birthday on January 3rd and Person 4 has a birthday on January 4th is only <b>one</b>.  This is because not only are the birthdays specified, but also the order of the set is specified.  {4, 3, 2, 1} would not be in the event set because the order is wrong - Person 1 has a birthday on January 4th, Person 2 has a birthday on January 3rd, Person 3 has a birthday on January 2nd and Person 4 has a birthday on January 4th - this violates the conditions specified by the event for which we're analyzing.  \n\nSo the problem asks you about the size of the event set where every person has a birthday of January 1 - which should be clear after reading that last paragraph.

Here is how I suggest approaching the problem.\n\nSay m is the number of different characters.\n\nThe sample space is the choice of each player. As each player has m choices the size of this space is $$m^{2k}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of choice-vectors such that the two teams match.\n\nFirst, let's solve the problem for the case where there are two characters, i.e. m=2. In this case one number suffices to characterize the\ndistribution: the number of character 1 and the number of character 2. Lets call those i and k-i. The number of choice-vectors\nthat satisfy this in a single team is $${k \\choose i}$$. Therefor the number of choice vectors for both teams is \n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k} {k \\choose i}^2$$\n\nIf this is clear, the next step is to consider larger values of m.\n\nI believe this can be done using a binary encoding of the 8 characters (luckily, a power of 2.

Once you have the z-score, you just need to plug it into Q function and you got the probability of the tail.\n\nNote that erf is the function that the professor expects you to learn. All three of Q,$$\\Phi$$ and erf serve the same purpose, that is to calculate the area under a normal curve, and it is easy to convert between each other. You will find the formulae for the conversion on the wikipedia link that I put in the instructor note.\n\nEssentially, Q function calculates the area of the tail of a standard normal distribution, and $$\\Phi$$ calculates the head; erf(x) is twice the area from mean to x under a zero-mean normal distribution with variance 1/2. erf(x) is positive if the area is to the right of the mean. erf(x) is negative if the area is to the left of the mean. \n\nThe z-score of a value on a non-standard normal distribution is basically its counterpart on a standard normal distribution. So you can directly plug z-score into Q or $$\\Phi$$, but not erf. You can, however, plug z-score/sqrt(2) into erf to fit the normal distribution with variance 1/2 on which erf is defined.\n\nYou can get the value of these functions using http://www.wolframalpha.com/.","created":"2012-11-04T06:23:00Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","data":null,"bucket_name":"Today"}],"anon":"no","no_upvotes":0,"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h92kc9gwjs8io","bucket_order":3,"updated":"2012-11-03T10:02:07Z","created":"2012-11-03T10:02:07Z","subject":"Mine gives two numbers and asks for the probability that the woman is between those two.

Thus, $$var[X_i] = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$$. \n\nThen, we know $$X_i$$ are independent for different i, so  $$var[\\sum X_i] = \\sum var[X_i] = n * var[X_i] = n * p(1-p)$$.

Although if you wanted to, you could, it's just that it would be a tedious amount of calculation. But just in case it comes up useful later, I'll explain it briefly.\n\nSo to find $$E[X]$$, you find $$\\sum_{i} p_i * x_i$$ for all possible values of $$x_i$$ and where $$p_i$$ represents the $$P(X = x_i)$$. To find $$E[X^2]$$, you basically do the same thing except that you have $$x_i^2$$: \n$$E[X^2] = \\sum_{i} p_i * x_i^2$$ for the same $$x_i$$ and $$p_i$$.\n\nThe way I did it was that I considered $$X_i$$ to be the random variable representing whether the monkey got question i right. So, $$X_i = 1$$ when the monkey gets it right, and $$X_i = 0$$ when wrong. \n\nThen, since all $$X_i$$ are independent for differing i, we can just find $$var(X_i)$$ which are equal for all i, and then take the sum. So, $$var(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} var(X_i) = k * var(X_i)$$ and so to get the standard deviation we just take the square root of that.","subject":"","created":"2012-11-05T20:07:14Z","uid":"glviobylIFz"}],"children":[],"tag_endorse_arr":[],"config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"h960u5lephn6j0","tag_endorse":[],"created":"2012-11-05T20:07:14Z","data":{"embed_links":[]},"bucket_name":"Today"}],"tags":["1","homework14","problem1","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":241,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h951yzsk58457y","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-05T03:51:13Z","uid":"h0zwqdowwn652a","data":"h951yzsl7lm57z"},{"type":"update","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-05T03:51:27Z","data":"h951za8et4k5s0"},{"type":"update","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-05T03:52:12Z","data":"h952098evl3t0"},{"type":"s_answer","to":"h951yzsk58457y","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-05T05:08:37Z","data":"h954qiyuxth3qc"},{"type":"followup","to":"h951yzsk58457y","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-05T19:28:46Z","uid":"h7nyiaan2dv4yg"},{"type":"i_answer","to":"h951yzsk58457y","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-05T20:07:14Z","uid":"glviobylIFz","data":"h960u5lgva36j1"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h951yzsk58457y","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-05T21:01:24Z","uid":"glviobylIFz"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-11-05T03:51:13Z","status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"full","content":"What is the z-score of X = 13?

So, for any z score we can separate the normal distribution into the right and left portion, or tail. Q(z) is typically what we call the area under the right tail, and $$\\phi(x)$$ is typically what we call the area of the left. \n\nWith that in mind, Qinv(x) is the inverse of Q(z), so instead of taking a z score and giving you the area under the right tail, it instead takes the area under the right tail and gives you back the z score which would give you that area.\n\nHopefully that makes sense to you. So to find the tails, the left and right tail values are actually just $$\\alpha$$. So, all you need to do is use the Qinv(x) function to get the z scores associated with those values. Note that when using Qinv(x), it's always expecting the area under the right tail, so if you want the z score associated with a significance level for something that's not the right tail, you'll have to find what the area under the right tail is, or use symmetry if possible. \n\nIn case it still doesn't make sense to you, I'll walk you through the first one and hopefully you can use it as an example to solve the other ones. if you get it though, ignore the rest of this post entirely as it would be much better for you to work this out on your own. \n\nSo for the first problem, it's asking you for the z value which would give you the significance level of $$\\alpha$$ under the left tail. We know that Qinv(x) gives you the z score corresponding to area x under the right tail, but it's asking for the left. We know though, that the area under the entire normal curve is always 1, so if the area under the left tail is 0.02, we can find the area under the right tail, which is $$1 - 0.02 = 0.98$$. So, we can take Qinv(0.98) to find the answer. \n\nWhile this is an easy way to do it, there is an even easier way to do it which involves no calculation and in my opinion shows a stronger understanding. You want the area under the left tail to be 0.02, but you know that the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean. Well, we can easily find z for 0.02 significance level under the right tail, which is Qinv(0.02), and we know that the normal is symmetric, so the z value for 0.02 significance under the left tail is just $$- Qinv(0.02)$$","created":"2012-11-13T18:36:05Z","uid":"glviobylIFz","data":null,"bucket_name":"This week"}],"anon":"full","no_upvotes":0,"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h9gsn2p3pue2s6","bucket_order":4,"updated":"2012-11-13T09:03:15Z","created":"2012-11-13T09:03:15Z","subject":"so to find the tails:\nthe left tail value would be .5 - alpha and you take the z-score of that\n\nthe right tail value would be 1 - alpha and you take the z score of that\n\nthe two tailed value would be (1-alpha)/2 and you take the z score of that\n\nand then would you take the Qinv(z-scores) to arrive at the area under the tails?

What we want, is z so that the right tail is alpha/2.","created":"2012-11-14T04:30:00Z","uid":"glviobylIFz","data":null,"bucket_name":"This week"},{"type":"feedback","children":[],"anon":"stud","config":{},"bucket_order":4,"id":"h9hyvkadztz58w","updated":"2012-11-14T04:45:35Z","subject":"so, is it like 2*Qinv(alpha/2) ?","created":"2012-11-14T04:45:35Z","uid":"h7nyiai926b4yu","data":null,"bucket_name":"This week"},{"type":"feedback","children":[],"anon":"stud","config":{},"bucket_order":4,"id":"h9hz6gbzygy5ck","updated":"2012-11-14T04:54:03Z","subject":"^I tried 2*Qinv(alpha/2) but that is not the answer.

This gives you the z value which has area x under the right tail. If you multiply this by 2, what you get is another z value, but you really have no idea what the area under this new value is at all(unless of course you look it up). \n\nI'll try to walk you through this. So, we've established that we want a total of $$\\alpha$$ under the two tails right? Then we said that since they are symmetric, we want each tail to have $$\\alpha/2$$.\n\nNow, all we need is the z value which has area $$\\alpha/2$$ under the right tail. We know that -z also has area $$\\alpha/2$$ under the left tail by symmetry. So what is the z value with $$\\alpha/2$$ under the right tail?

What did you do? Well presumably you just looked at the table of Z scores or used the Q function, and then saw if the area under the tail was smaller than alpha, and if it was, you rejected. \n\nNow we are just asking you to do the same thing but backwards, we give you the z score, and ask you what p score, which you can think of it as having a random variable for alpha, will the test reject?

We consider the tail to be the smaller of the two areas, so if z is positive then it will be to the right and if z is negative it will be to the left. \n\nJust for a bit, let's think about the normal distribution itself.

Question 4 asks the probability that all these k bits are set to 1, which is easy given the answer for question 3.","subject":"","created":"2012-11-23T12:01:00Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez"}],"children":[],"tag_endorse_arr":[],"config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"h9v9e6z1r1s2t3","tag_endorse":[],"created":"2012-11-23T12:01:00Z","data":{"embed_links":[]},"bucket_name":"Today"}],"tags":["8","hw19","student"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":330,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T03:45:42Z","uid":"gqpjxn5udij","data":"h9urp8g34nd4ed"},{"type":"followup","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T07:41:06Z","uid":"h7nyiak6y9j4z4"},{"type":"followup","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T07:54:35Z","uid":"gqpjxn5udij"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T07:56:27Z","uid":"h7nyiak6y9j4z4"},{"type":"i_answer","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T12:01:00Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","data":"h9v9e6z4gc72t4"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T12:01:24Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez"},{"type":"i_answer_update","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T12:11:04Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","data":"h9v9r4mdm3l4o"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T12:14:43Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-23T21:15:49Z","uid":"h7nyiak6y9j4z4"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-24T05:50:55Z"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-24T05:57:31Z"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"no","when":"2012-11-24T05:57:52Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez"},{"type":"feedback","to":"h9urp8g1iaj4ec","anon":"full","when":"2012-11-25T01:24:12Z"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-11-23T03:45:42Z","status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"I thought solving this question would be similar to solving Problem #3 of hw15, but instead of using p = 1/4, we should use the probability that the smallest value corresponds to a word in both A and B.

I'm assuming you found the answer to the previous question. That is 1/((k/n)*e^-1)). This translates to ne/k. This formula is for the expected additional time it takes for one of the k processes to access the database. In that case, you need to find the sum (from k=1 to n) ne/k. That is $$\\sum ne/k = ne \\sum 1/k $$. (I don't know how to add from 1 to n on the side of the sum sign) Then you use the harmonic series, which says the sum of 1/i from i=1 to m is equivalent ln(m). Apply this equation to 1/k.

The 50 documents are not supposed to be considered in a whole, just think about each individual pair.\n\nSo say we are computing the similarity score of document A and B. The exact score is $$p = \\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A\\cup B|}$$, which requires counting all words in both documents and is expensive to compute. Here comes the minHash algorithm that <b>estimates</b> this score, $$\\hat{p}$$, in a much faster way. Say we run the algorithm on A and B for $$k$$ iterations. In each iteration it hashes A to a <b>random</b> word in A, and hashes B to a random word in B, then compare the two words. If they match, count as 1, and otherwise 0. It turns out that in each iteration the probability of getting 1 is exactly $$p$$. So we run the algorithm for $$k$$ iterations, and use the sample mean of $$k$$ match/unmatch results to estimate this probability. Since this is a large sample estimate, we have the normal curve that describes its distribution, centered around the true mean of $$p$$. With this curve we can find the probability that $$\\hat{p}$$ taking whatever value.\n\nThis is just for one pair, which is what part 1-3 are about. Then we consider all the pairs among 50 documents, and all pairs have the same false negative rate. Note that the false negative rate of every pair is independent with another, so again, we have a large sample sum problem.\n\nI don't think visualizing the hash table will help you getting the concept here.","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","bucket_name":"Yesterday","data":null}],"anon":"full","no_upvotes":0,"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"ha3j7ehz54y6gu","bucket_order":3,"updated":"2012-11-29T06:57:49Z","created":"2012-11-29T06:57:49Z","subject":"oh okay then you use .8 to get the z-score which is .788 based on the chart and Q(.788) will give you the probability of the right side of z and since 1 is the value of the whole graph it would be 1-Q(.788)? which is not correct am i looking at this the wrong way?","bucket_name":"Yesterday","data":null},{"type":"followup","d-bucket":"Yesterday","children":[{"type":"feedback","d-bucket":"Yesterday","children":[],"anon":"full","config":{},"bucket_order":3,"id":"ha48ddlkxd227e","updated":"2012-11-29T18:42:18Z","subject":"i just read the t.a's response he says that you should be focusing on each individual pair so should it be that mu = 1pair/2elements and n = 2? well that's not right either","created":"2012-11-29T18:42:18Z","data":null,"bucket_name":"Yesterday"},{"type":"feedback","children":[],"anon":"no","config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"ha4jzljyts95bp","updated":"2012-11-30T00:07:31Z","subject":"For n documents, there are n choose 2 pairs","created":"2012-11-30T00:07:31Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","data":null,"bucket_name":"Today"},{"type":"feedback","children":[],"anon":"no","config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"ha4k2m5844qfd","updated":"2012-11-30T00:09:52Z","subject":"Also, for sample MEAN, the mean is p, variance is p(1-p)/n; for sample SUM, the mean is np, variance is np(1-p).

There are 5 &quot;bins&quot; which represent the numbers 1 through 5. We select 2 balls (with replacement) from the 5 balls. We have the following possible sets to represent the numbering of the balls when order does not matter\n{1,1},{1,2}{1,3}{1,4}{1,5}{2,2}{2,3}{2,4}{2,5}{3,3}{3,4}{3,5}{4,4}{4,5}{5,5}\n\nSo the size of the outcome space is 15. This is equivalent to (2+(5-1) choose 2) which is equivalent to (6 choose 2). This is stars and bars, like I was doing above.

Well I knew that there is a 1/36 chance to roll a 12 and 35/36 chance to get any other sum. Since we are looking for 2 rolls to be 12, two rolls out of 5 will each have a probability of 1/36 of getting a 12, and 3 out of 5 rolls will each have a 35/36 probability to get a sum other than 12. However we need to also take into account how many different ways 2 out of 5 12s can be rolled. So we must do C(5,2) in order to figure out how many ways we can pick 2 of those rolls to be 12s out of 5 rolls. Now we just multiply everything together C(5,2)*(1/36)^2*(35/36)^3 and that's the answer. \n\n\nI don't understand why the hint gets into using stars and bars. I don't see how that can be applicable in this scenario. I can't see where the 12 stars came from. Can anyone give me a more detailed explanation? Also if I had just coincidentally gotten my answer then please let me know. \n#testpreparationcb","subject":"TestPrep CB 9","created":"2012-12-14T15:16:10Z","uid":"h7nyiakpf134z6"}],"type":"question","children":[{"type":"followup","children":[],"anon":"full","no_upvotes":0,"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"hapl8fbopij5z3","bucket_order":2,"updated":"2012-12-14T17:25:32Z","created":"2012-12-14T17:25:32Z","subject":"Thank you, that explanation was extremely helpful, I was very confused by the hint.","bucket_name":"Today","data":null}],"tags":["student","testpreparationcb","unanswered"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":455,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":1,"id":"hapgm2evd351an","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-12-14T15:16:10Z","uid":"h7nyiakpf134z6","data":"hapgm2f2nqz1ao"},{"type":"followup","to":"hapgm2evd351an","anon":"full","when":"2012-12-14T17:25:32Z"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-12-14T15:16:10Z","status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"no","content":"Could someone please explain to me why the lower bound of accuracy is 1-Q((0.8-0.88)*sqrt(4n)), too?  \n#final #testpreparation","subject":"TestpreparationRA problem 1 the second to the last","created":"2012-12-14T18:10:35Z","uid":"h7nyia21h9k4xx"}],"type":"question","children":[],"tags":["final","student","testpreparation","unanswered"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":456,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":1,"id":"hapmudaosn5xg","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"no","when":"2012-12-14T18:10:35Z","uid":"h7nyia21h9k4xx","data":"hapmudaqu76xh"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-12-14T18:10:35Z","status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"full","content":"My question has 13% independent out of 40 people. the last part is asking to find the probability that 2 or more are independent, so I did the complement and found the probability of 0 or 1 and then did (1-(P(0)+P(1)))\nthe answer comes out to be 1-((((40!)/((40!)(0!)))(0.13^0)*(0.87^40))+(((40!)/((39!)(1!)))(0.13^1)*(0.87^39))) if I am not mistaken, can anyone possibly point to where I am going wrong? \n#testpreparation","subject":"testprep dp #5 last part","created":"2012-12-14T18:34:05Z"},{"anon":"full","content":"My question has 13% independent out of 40 people. the last part is asking to find the probability that 2 or more are independent, so I did the complement and found the probability of 0 or 1 and then did (1-P(0)+P(1))\nthe answer comes out to be 1-((((40!)/((40!)(0!)))(0.13^0)*(0.87^40))+(((40!)/((39!)(1!)))(0.13^1)*(0.87^39))) if I am not mistaken, can anyone possibly point to where I am going wrong? \n#testpreparation","subject":"testprep dp #5 last part","created":"2012-12-14T18:33:29Z"}],"type":"question","children":[{"type":"i_answer","history":[{"anon":"no","content":"I can see nothing wrong with your answer.","subject":"","created":"2012-12-14T21:32:11Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez"}],"children":[],"tag_endorse_arr":[],"config":{},"bucket_order":2,"id":"hapu1mocort131","tag_endorse":[],"created":"2012-12-14T21:32:11Z","data":{"embed_links":[]},"bucket_name":"Today"}],"tags":["5","student","testpreparation"],"tag_good_arr":[],"nr":457,"tag_good":[],"config":{},"no_answer":0,"id":"hapnntecnew787","change_log":[{"type":"create","anon":"full","when":"2012-12-14T18:33:29Z","data":"hapnnteen0o788"},{"type":"update","anon":"full","when":"2012-12-14T18:34:05Z","data":"hapnokozl0r3zy"},{"type":"i_answer","to":"hapnntecnew787","anon":"no","when":"2012-12-14T21:32:12Z","uid":"gx9p3i9tlpg4ez","data":"hapu1mq9j1s133"}],"no_answer_followup":0,"created":"2012-12-14T18:33:29Z","status":"active"},{"history":[{"anon":"full","content":"how do we get those Pr(A), Pr(B), and Pr(C) ?
