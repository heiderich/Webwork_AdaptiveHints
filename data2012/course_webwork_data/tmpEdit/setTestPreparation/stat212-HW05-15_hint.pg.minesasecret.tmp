In the game of roulette, a steel ball is rolled 
onto a wheel that contains 18 red, 18 black, and 
2 green slots.  If the ball is rolled $rolls times, 
find the probability of the following events.
$PAR
A. The ball falls into the green slots $a or more times.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. The ball does not fall into any green slots.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C. The ball falls into black slots $c or more times.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
D.  The ball falls into red slots $d or fewer times.

$SOLUTION
$PAR
Part A: $BR
Let G be a random variable which is the number of balls that fall into green slots(so, if G = 1 that means only one ball fell into a green bin). $BR
\( P[G \ge $a] = 1 - P[G < 5] = 1 - (P[G=0] + P[G=1] + ... + P[G=$a - 1])\) $BR
This last step is possible because the events are mutually exclusive. Then, $BR
\( P[G=n] = {$rolls\choose n} * (2/38)^n * (1 - 2/38)^{$rolls - n}\) $BR
With that, you can find \(1 - \sum_{i=0}^{$a - 1} P[G=i]\) to get the answer.

$PAR
Part B: $BR
\(P[green] = 2/38 \Rightarrow P[not_green] = 1-2/38 = 36/38\) for a single throw. $BR
For \($rolls\) rolls then, we have $BR
\((36/38)^{$rolls}\)

$PAR
Part C: $BR
Using the same strategy as in Part A, we can let B be a random variable representing the number of times the ball falls into a black slot. $BR
Then, we can find \(P[B \ge $c]\) by parts. That is, we just find $BR
\(\sum_{i=$c}^{18} P[B = i]\) 

$PAR
Part D: $BR
Again using the same strategy as in parts A and C we separate it into parts. Depending on the numbers you have for the problem, it may prove quicker to find the complement, so that you have to do less calculations. Regardless, you can find the answer either way. Again, you just need to find $BR
\(\sum_{i=0}^{$d} P[R = i]\) $BR
where R is the number of times the ball falls into a red slot. If it is easier, you can also find $BR
\(1 - \sum_{i = $d + 1}^{$rolls}\)
