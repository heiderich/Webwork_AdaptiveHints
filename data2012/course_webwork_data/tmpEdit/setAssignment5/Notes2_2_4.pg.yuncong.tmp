## The coupon collector problem ##

Many probability questions turn out to be thinly disguised balls-and-bins problems. Here's an example. Suppose that each cereal box contains one of [`k`] action figures (chosen uniformly at random). How many cereal boxes should you buy in order to collect all [`k`] figures? [__________]{2k*ln(k)}

### Solution ###

If you make the following associations:

[``
\begin{itemize}
\item bin  =  action figure
\item throw a ball =  buy a box of cereal
\item every bin gets a ball = you collect all the figures
\end{itemize}
``]

then you see that what we are really asking is, how many balls do you need to throw into [`n = k`] bins in order to hit all of them? And we've already seen that [`m = 2k\ln k`] balls (cereal boxes) will suffice.
