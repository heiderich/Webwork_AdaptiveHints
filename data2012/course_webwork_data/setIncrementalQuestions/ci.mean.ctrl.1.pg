BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
WPI sets an expectation of 17 hours work per week for a 1/3 unit seven week undergraduate course, which
equals 119 hours per term. To see if reality meets expectations, a WPI project team took a random sample of
7 1/3 unit courses and from each course, randomly selected one student volunteer to follow during the term.
Each selected student agreed to keep track of the hours spent on coursework for that course. The totals for
the term are below:
$PAR

\[ \begin{array}{cccccccc}
$y[0] & $y[1] & $y[2] & $y[3] & $y[4] & $y[5] & $y[6] \cr
\end{array} \]

$PAR
The project team was interested in determining how the average time spent by all WPI students on a 1/3 unit seven week undergraduate course compares with the 119 hour guideline.
$PAR
$PAR Construct the 95% confident interval for the mean of studying hours per term.
