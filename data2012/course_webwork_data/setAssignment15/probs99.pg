BEGIN_PGML

Suppose we flip a coin [$tosses] times, and the coin comes up heads [$heads] times.  Should we conclude that the coin is biased?  Ie [`P(H) \neq 1/2`].  

To show that the coin is biased, we want to show that an unbiased coin is very unlikely to have produced a sequence with as many heads.  

Let [`X_i`] be a random variable which is 1 if the i'th unbiased coin toss is heads and 0 otherwise. The random variable [`X=\sum_{i=1}^{[$tosses]} X_i`] is the random variable which corresponds to the total number of heads. 

Calculate the following quantities.     
1. [`\mathbb{E}(X_i) = `] [_______]{"1/2"}
2. [`std(X_i) = `] [______]{"1/2"}
3. [`\mathbb{E}(X) = `] [_______]{"(1/2)*$tosses"}
4. [`std(X) = `] [______]{"sqrt($tosses*(1/2)*(1/2))"}
5. Using the values [`\mathbb{E}(X)`], [`\mathbb{\sigma}(X)`] you computed above, calculate the z-score corresponding to the value [$heads]?  [_____]{$zscore}
6. Assuming a fair coin is tossed [$tosses] times, what is the probability at least [$heads] heads come up?  [______]{"Q($zscore)"}  Hint: Q(z) is [`Pr(X >= z)`] for X the standard normal density.  
7. What is the absolute difference between the number of heads we see ([$heads]), and the expected number of heads from flipping an unbiased coin, [`\mathbb{E}(X)`]?  [_____]{"$heads-($tosses/2)"} Call this deviation [`\delta`].  
8. What is [`Pr(|X - \mathbb{E}(X)| \geq \delta)`]?  [_______]{"2*Q($zscore)"}  Hint: your answer from (6) is helpful here.  In (6) you were considering one tail, now you need to consider two.  
9. Do you have reason to believe the coin being tossed is not fair (0=no,1=yes)? [___]{"1"}
