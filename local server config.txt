- Start by downloading Vagrant for your platform: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
	- Vagrant is a tool for setting development environments as Virtual Machines- Then get VirtualBox to run the dev VM: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads- Lastly, install Ansible: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html (tl;dr: `pip install ansible`)
	- Ansible is a tool for provisioning/configuring development environments- Then, in the root of Webwork_AdaptiveHints(make sure you get the most current pull), type `vagrant up`.
	- This will download a base VM image, install all the necessary dependencies for Webwork and Python stuff,
	  and configure (almost) everything you need for a development environment for the adaptive hints infrastructure	- If the provisioning fails, make note of what failed and re-run the provisioning(`vagrant provision`),
	  otherwise your server might not be fully configured. Email Zhen the error if you can’t get pass it.- Replace references to webwork.cse.ucsd.edu with 192.168.33.10 in:	- src/adaptive-hint-clients/teacher_client/ng/js/constants.js	- src/adaptive-hint-servers/rest_server/scripts/checkanswer.pl	- src/adaptive-hint-servers/rest_server/scripts/renderPG.pl- Set default database username/password of webworkWrite/webwork in src/adaptive-hint-servers/rest_server/webwork_config.py- Configure and run services…	- run /vagrant/src/adaptive-hint-servers/init-scripts/deploy.sh	- run /vagrant/src/adaptive-hint-servers/init-scripts/restart-servers.sh- Restart apache2/nginx…s	- `sudo service apache2 restart`	- `sudo service nginx restart`- Browse to http://192.168.33.10/webwork2, see if webwork runs- Browse to http://192.168.33.10/teacher/ng, see if hint client works- Remember, do not push any of the change to github.
